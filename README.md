# Python-with-Coursera
This is a repo where I'd be keeping all programs I've written in Coursera
The Python Scripting course is the first course in the specialization, where I learned about Python functions, modules, semantics, etc.
I would separate the repo into 4 directories where each is dedicated to each specialization
